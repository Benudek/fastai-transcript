<h2>Lesson 14: Super resolution; Image segmentation with Unet</h2>

In this final lesson, we do a deep dive into super resolution, an amazing technique that allows us to restore high resolution detail in our images, based on a convolutional neural network. In the process, we’ll look at a few modern techniques for faster and more reliable training of generative convnets.

We close with a look at image segmentation, in particular using the Unet architecture, a state of the art technique that has won many Kaggle competitions and is widely used in industry. Image segmentation models allow us to precisely classify every part of an image, right down to pixel level.

We hope you enjoyed your deep learning journey with us! Now that you’ve finished, be sure to drop by the forums to tell us how you’re using deep learning in your life or work, or what projects you’re considering working on now.
