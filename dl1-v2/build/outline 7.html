<h2>Lesson 7: Resnets from scratch</h2>

We finish off our recurrent neural network from scratch implementation from last week, and introduce the GRU and LSTM cells to allow training of long sequences with RNNs.

Then we complete this part of the course with a return to computer vision, where we implement the powerful resnet architecture and batch normalization layer from scratch. Congratulations on completing the course! Be sure to let us know on the forums about what projects you have built, and what you’re planning next…
