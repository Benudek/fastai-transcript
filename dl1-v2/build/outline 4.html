<h2>Lesson 4: Structured, time series, & language models</h2>

We complete our work from the previous lesson on tabular/structured, time-series data, and learn about how to avoid overfitting by using dropout regularization. We then introduce natural language processing with recurrent neural networks, and start work on a language model.
